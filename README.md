# Android_5Things

#Introduction
This app is based on the project of Android Development for Beginners on Udacity.

It asks five questions about Disneyland, and asks you to choose the answer by clicking on the answers.

If you get the answer right, you move on to the next question until the end.

However, if you have the wrong answer, it will show an image to tell you that you got the wrong answer, and then you can keep on answering again.

The program will return back to the Android main menu once the user finishes all the questions, or presses the exit sign.
